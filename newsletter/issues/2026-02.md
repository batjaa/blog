## Family

I met my wife Suvdaa late 2019 through a mutual friend, Amaraa. We hit it off pretty quick. I moved back to the states and we relocated to Seattle, WA in October 2020. Got married, made it official.

Our first son Huslen was born late 2022, and our second, Sanchir, came along in January 2024. Life's been full ever since.

Lately I've been making a conscious effort to be more present — as a husband and as a father — while the boys are still young. These years go fast. We've been hanging out with our neighbors more, just enjoying the everyday stuff. Nothing fancy, and honestly that's the best part.

## Professional

By day, I'm a software engineer — still grinding. On the side, I got into day trading as a new venture. It's been working out ok-ish. I feel like it's make it or break it time coming soon.

I'll be sharing my P&L every month here for accountability. Keeps me honest.

Also, I'm back on Instagram [@wander.van](https://instagram.com/wander.van) after stepping away from social media for a couple of years. Felt like it was time.

## Health

The 30s caught me by surprise. I put weight lifting aside and joined Suvdaa on pilates. Let me tell you — pilates is the stupidest looking small movements that somehow have your tendons pulling in ways you didn't know possible. Total ego killer. The burn is real.

I gave up running years ago. Bad knees, can't even do a mile or two anymore without paying for it. So the goal now is to fix my back before the 40s hit. Light weights, yoga, and pilates. That's the plan.

## Travel

We went to Japan for a month in September 2025 and hit Thailand in late November. Originally the plan was to do quarterly extended trips, but let me tell you — it's a whole different game with two young boys. Way more challenging and tiring than we expected. Still worth it, but the logistics are no joke.
