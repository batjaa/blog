## Family

This month was all about getting back into routines after the holidays. Huslen started back at preschool and has been loving it - his teacher says he's one of the most social kids in class.

Sanchir is growing so fast! He's starting to babble more and we're pretty sure he said "dada" last week (Suvd disagrees and thinks it was just random sounds, but I'm counting it).

We took the kids to the Seattle Aquarium for the first time. Huslen was obsessed with the otters and Sanchir just wanted to touch everything.

## Professional

January was a solid month at Samsara. We shipped the new fleet analytics dashboard that I've been working on for the past quarter. The feedback from customers has been really positive.

I've also been diving deeper into Go lately. Coming from TypeScript, the explicit error handling felt verbose at first, but I'm starting to appreciate how it forces you to think about failure modes upfront.

Started mentoring a new grad on the team. It's been rewarding but also a good reminder of how much I've learned in the past few years.

## Health

Getting back on track after holiday indulgences. Hit the gym 12 times this month (goal was 15, so not bad).

Started doing more mobility work after reading about how important it is for longevity. My hips are thanking me.

Current stats:
- Weight: 175 lbs
- Running: 15 miles total
- Lifting: 3x per week

## Travel

No big trips this month, but we did explore some new spots in Bothell:

- Found an amazing pho place on Main Street
- Discovered a great hiking trail at Saint Edward State Park - can't believe we hadn't been there before
- Planning a trip to Vancouver BC in February for our anniversary
