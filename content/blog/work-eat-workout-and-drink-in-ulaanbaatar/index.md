Traveling to Mongolia? Going on an expat mission to Mongolia? I got some tips for you.

I’ve been back to my home country, Mongolia, last year for almost half a year. Every time I go back, lot of things change, fast. So to spare your time wondering which coffee shop to go or where to spend your Friday evening I went through the places I went when I was back and put them here in a list.

Hope it will be helpful.

#### Generally

Use or have at least a facebook account. Everything goes through facebook in Mongolia. Wanna make friends? Wanna find places to go? Need to find an address of a place? You will often times find something that you can’t in google in facebook.

_*Logistics*_

If you think you will be mostly taking the bus, there is a card that you need to purchase. You can see where you can purchase this card here and it looked like people use this application to track when the bus schedule.

If you’re looking for domestic travel this could be very helpful. I was surprisingly pleased to use the service. It’s fairly new and honestly a big improvement.

I’m not including any train and flight information since those can be found easily if you search for them in google.

I didn’t really bother taking the bus since taxis are cheap in Ulaanbaatar. You can mostly get anywhere in the city for less than 5$, at most 10$. There’re few official taxis, to take a cab just stand next to a street and raise your hand. In rush hour finding a cab might take some time. Due to that I wished I had a bus ticket sometimes but it’s fine. It’s usually the unpleasant weather that got me. Downtown is small enough you can walk anywhere.

_*Tipping*_

Be kind and tip if possible. People will definitely appreciate it. Tipping is not part of the culture but keep in mind people make almost nothing in the service industry, pay is very low.

_*How expensive is Ulaanbaatar?*_

Expensive changes with context. In the states if anything is less 30$ and has some good value, I wouldn’t think it’s expensive, I’d think it’s the right price. Anything over that would feel expensive. e.g. a great fancy-y meal? 30$ great! Watching a movie with someone? 30$ great! An amazing tshirt or a normal pair of pants, 30$? Great! A taxi ride from the airport to home after 20 hours of travel? Great! A nightout with some friends, 2 drinks and tip 30$? Good value! How much would I feel the same in Ulaanbaatar? 30k Tugrug (~12$). Or maybe even less, 20–25K tugrug (~10$).

#### Food

Restaurants and dinning in Ulaanbaatar has been rapidly changing in the last few years. Many Mongolians who have lived and studied abroad are taking what they’ve experienced and learned back and fusing it with Mongolia’s culture. Without further due:

- Route 22 — newly opened. Has some great steaks and overall great comfort food. Looked like they have great selection for whine as well.
- Veranda — great pasta selection, has a bar downstairs with some warm curd drinks and Mongolian style cocktails.
- Choijin Temple Restaurant — you gotta try one of the dishes with bone marrow. Freaking good.
- Hazara — great Indian food the very first one that brought Indian dishes to Mongolia.
  Mongolians — one of my old time favorites. Good selection of Mongolian dishes. Try the stomach salad? Can’t remember the dish name. But felt like - it has bit outdated.
- Namaste — another good option for Indian food.
- Arig Ramen — If ramen is your thing you gotta visit this place. My favorite one is Arig ramen.
- Rock Salt — Decent food. I hated their cocktails. The bartender did a lousy job. I didn’t even get a buzz after 3 full drinks.
  Brooks — I was very surprised with this place. In fact I was in awe. The price is cheap. The food is delicious. The environment is cozy. If it - wasn’t far from the city I’d be living here.
- Brooklyn — My go to lunch place. Has an amazing soup. Called stress releaser. I’m telling you, it does it’s job.
- Miliko — I couldn’t find their address nor facebook page. Good spot for lunch.

I might have forgotten some great places but this should be a good start, right?

#### Breakfast/brunch

Brunch is not really a thing. But you can enjoy some comforty breakfast with some coffee and other drinks in these places.
https://goo.gl/maps/4kxYmEZrBEA2
- Code Patisserie & Plus - Great breakfast spot. Decent coffee. Though it's patisserie I didn't like their patisserie that much.
- Rosewood - Best eggs benedict in town. They do have a decent bottomless mimosas.
- Millie's espresso - Have great breakfast selection. Good coffee and a cozy environment. But out of all that the crowd that come here are very interesting.

#### Coffee and coffee shops

Coffee has become a thing, it was't until recent. When you go somewhere and ask for coffee you used to get a 3-in-1 instant coffee mixed in hot water. But now you go to a mid class restaurant or such, expect you will get served an Americano.

I'll spare you with all the boring details about coffee. Most of the coffees that are being served in Ulaanbaatar will be espresso based drinks. You will need to go around to find places that serves drip or differently brewed coffee. And it's very hard to find dark roasts. I've heard it doesn't get produced that much because some people don't like the bitterness of dark roast so .

- Nayra - (espresso drinks) One of my old time favorites. Great environment and good coffee. Though my coffee taste has changed I realized I don't like their coffee as much as I used to do.
- Cafe Camino - (espresso, drip) Latest addition to my most favorite places. Best coffee in town, has good wifi, great location and good crowd. You may even get lucky and experience their process of roasting coffee. They will put a lot of effort in it and even hand select the beans.
- Roc - (espresso, drip, french press, vacuum pot, mocha pot) Great coffee selection. I haven't enjoyed the crowd as much and the place was a little bit too hip for me.
- Coffee Esperanto - A favorite barista recently opened this small place, pretty good.
- UBeans - Great place! Love their coffee and cookies. A great spot for breakfast as well. Internet is the only problem I have.
- Ziferblat - A cozy space for communities. They arrange weekly meetups on different topics and have a weekly movie night as well. If you're looking for making some new connections this is a great spot.

You will find some many Korean chain coffee shops. Not a big fan of those but everything comes down to a personal taste.

#### Coworking spaces

3 well known spots

https://goo.gl/maps/2Fb6HH5FiT32

- Club coworking - By far the best. Great community, interesting people. 10$/day is decent. Don't remember having any problem with the internet. Great location, easy to meet people and having lunch, dinner. Tables and chairs were a little bit uncomfortable.
- SMS Startup - Great location. I've worked from here but I've been here couple of times for meetings. Biggest advantage they have is their support team. They will provide with legal and marketing advices to new startups. Good spot for widening your network.
- Startup terminal - Only if it was in downtown. Great for working for long term.

#### Health

You will find a gym in Ulaanbaatar on every corner. Finding a decent clean one with great ventilation is a journey. But gym aside you can find great martial art classes in Ulaanbaatar.
Garuda - During my stay I was training here. Very knowledgeable staff. Has MMA and BJJ classes. Some of the teacher have good English, if not classmates.

_*Massages*_

Yes, I'm a big fan of massages. Have had many, have given many. I'm sure I'm qualified for judging them, too. Been to many of them in Ulaanbaatar as well.

- Joy - I like this spot a lot they don't use oil which much pleasant. Walk ins are welcome. Most of the staff are very good and great price (~35k tugrug).
- Lotus thai massage - I've been here only once. Wasn't the best but I think it was my own fault because I couldn't express what I wanted well to the masseuse. I really liked the atmosphere and I want to like this place a lot. Need to schedule an appointment first.
- Mt. Bogd Golf club - Great service and super clean. Just for the standard of their service, this is a must go place.

#### Near Ulaanbaatar

Terelj - Good escape. Lovely hikable hills and newly opened great lodges. You can go everyweekend to each corner and explore more.
Bogd khaan hiking - Good spot for a hike. If you need an escape from the city atmosphere and some fresh air this is spot is close enough.

#### Drinking/clubbing/night life

I like do drink whisky. Occasionally beer. The drinking culture is quit different in Mongolia. Everyone drinks vodka and everyone wants you to drink vodka.
Looking for a good bottle of whisky? Hard to find and a bit more expensive. But not impossible.
- Xanadu wine - So far the only spot I like to shop for whiskeys. MSM imports most of the whiskey in Mongolia. But I couldn't find a direct distributer to peers.
- Rooftop lounges - there are many rooftop lounges. They're mostly the same. I couldn't differentiate most of them from one another. Pick any of them and you should be good if you're looking for to spend some time in the cool evening breeze with some cocktails.
- Clubs - You can find many clubs in Ulaanbaatar as well. The most knowns are probably the following 3. I'm not a big clubber anyways so don't take my words.

https://goo.gl/maps/Vd5BsuDBSPA2

- Mint - most of my friends tend to like this one more than the others. I hear they have the better DJs than the other 2.
- Mojito - Good location since you can club hob just next to Choco. Felt a little bit crammed and small.
- Choco - Though I liked the interior it the dance floor felt very small. Potentially has some good drinks.

I didn't know where to put Cielo one of my favorite spots in Ulaanbaatar. Cozy environment, live music on some nights and good food. And besides all of that great cocktails!
